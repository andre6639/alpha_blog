# README

TO DO:

Create a homepage, about page.  Use the Alter Space html for this page, and generate an about page.
    -  Need to format styles for news stories on the homepage and then the 'About' within the about page.  Essentially we need to rip the
       methods out of the raw HTML page and make methods reference file, then create the layout for the about page to model the raw html layout,
       and the homepage to mirror 'myspace' home newstories layout
       ORRRRRR we compose a new concept blog as a framework for the conecpt.  This can start with a raw composed homepage and about page.
